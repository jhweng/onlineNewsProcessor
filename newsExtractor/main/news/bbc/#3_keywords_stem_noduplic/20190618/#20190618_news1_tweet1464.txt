@lewis_goodall @rorystewartuk not only have these idiots even less chance of tackling mental health, taxes, climate change etc. than may did, but the single issue they will be elected on by the tory membership is brexit. shame on the bbc for wasting an opportunity to get some clarity. hugely disappointing.
