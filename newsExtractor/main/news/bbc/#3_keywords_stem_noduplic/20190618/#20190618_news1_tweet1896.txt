@10downingstreet @theresa_may @bbc @sadiqkhan do you think that any of these issues had a positive impact on my mental health? i left teaching because of austerity in 2016. i got fed up of having to go through redundancy yearly because of education cuts. you see a teacher of my experience is too expensive.
