@texokie65 @senfeinstein @chrismurphyct the law may be current interpreted as you represent, but i believe that it is wrong. it is immoral to put the ownership of a weapon over the serious health crisis that is both gun violence itself and also the exacerbation of the mental health crisis.

we have to address it.
