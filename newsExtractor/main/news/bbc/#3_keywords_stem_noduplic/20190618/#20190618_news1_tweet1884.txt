@dean_maskell @mindcharity @theo2 that's great! (correct me if i'm wrong: guessing your experience filming "homeless ashes" gave you insight into the issues surrounding mental health at the street level, &amp; how more needs to be done before people end up there - + any other motivations you may have.) good luck!
