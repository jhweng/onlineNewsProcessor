@will_tanner @heidiowen12 @novembervivi @philiphensher @crisistextline @giveusashout the thing is -most teachers know how to identify which kids aren't doing well when it comes to their mental health. the issue is there isn't enough support, funding, or people to help. (especially in rural areas.) you may want to chat w/your former boss about that.
