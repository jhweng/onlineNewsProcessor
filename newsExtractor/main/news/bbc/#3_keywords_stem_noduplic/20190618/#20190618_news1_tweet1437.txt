@kieramariexx i'm still here &amp; on ig for you, too. it may be that some inactive accounts got deleted by ig. idk. but please don't push yourself too hard. taking a mental health break is so important, especially in this toxic cancel culture that's been created. please take care of you first. ðŸ’–
