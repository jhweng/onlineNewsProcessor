@autismmh @sectioned_ @ritb_ @tewv it's frankly laughable that gps are as abused by @tewv as are the patients/service users it serves

it says much about the culture and practices when even a gp doesn't think you should attend appointments as it may be further harmful to your mental health

cherry picking patients
