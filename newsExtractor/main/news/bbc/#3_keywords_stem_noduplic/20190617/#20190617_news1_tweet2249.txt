@ready2lead @leavesanddust @yeshacallahan @essence @kamalaharris honestly your continued excuses makes me feel like you don’t care about the child’s needs at all. yes parents may have mental/physical health concerns and that’s valid but if those issues create a failure to provide needs that is neglect. resources to help are needed.
