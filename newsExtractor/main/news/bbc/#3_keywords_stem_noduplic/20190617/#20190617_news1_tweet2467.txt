@theresa_may @southfieldsacad students and mental health:
how will i get thro uni without massive debt?
must get a part time job while studying?
the accommodation is extortionate - who pays Â£1,000 per month for a room?
that's if i pass my gcses maths/english. 
what is left to do if i don't get grade 4?
