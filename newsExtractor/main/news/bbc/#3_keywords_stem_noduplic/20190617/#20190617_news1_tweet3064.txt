@kathykattenburg @onlyjeffdavis @xan_desanctis i may not he here because i was ashamed of my situation and going to counseling would be an admission i was crazy. i am not alone in that and it is a very real issue.  

i do strongly support efforts to provide better mental health access and awareness.
