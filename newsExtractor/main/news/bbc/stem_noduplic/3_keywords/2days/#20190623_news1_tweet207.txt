if anyone is struggling with mental health issues please know that you are never alone. sometimes it may feel that way, but it isnt true. don't hesitate to get help, who you are today should not dictate who you are tomorrow. you matter just as much as everyone else. you are loved https://t.co/yukameoyzj
