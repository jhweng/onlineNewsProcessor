@drayanajordan @peter_grinspoon in my experience opiates create what seems like mental health problems. just getting off the opiates may solve  those behavioural issues. i had multiple drs telling me i needed depress/anxiety meds. i stopped the opiates, now i am fine. i used as prescribed, no addiction issues.
