@junglesheen @tamar_whyte @mianthrope @gazlamph @keirwales @nmpsychologist @jdvtherapy @revivepsycholo1 @post_p_pioneers not everyone is familiar with pd in all communities so perhaps bame mental health and trauma? i suspect trauma isn't even labelled as such. self harm may be more likely recognised.
