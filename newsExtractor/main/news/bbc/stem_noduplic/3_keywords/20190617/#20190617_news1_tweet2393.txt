@claireot @martina5458 @bailey6117 i'm in the uk, but the w.h.o. guidelines relate to us directly. the decision that transgender health issues are longer being classified as mental and behavioural disorders was only made at the end of may, so some guidelines may not have been updated yet. https://t.co/tt6tef1tvn
