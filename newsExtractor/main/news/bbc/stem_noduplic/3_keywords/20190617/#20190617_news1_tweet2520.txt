@angryblkhoemo @sirensongs @coffeespoonie and even if you have some sort of trained “mobile crisis” providers in your community, they may call for an ambulance and the ambulance may call for cops. but in that case at least you have actual mental health professionals as witnesses. that tends to make cops play nice.
