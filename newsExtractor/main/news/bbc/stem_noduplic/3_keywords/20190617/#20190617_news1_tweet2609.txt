@d_hablo @lowkey_faz if it's an unhealthy amount of weight then you should bring it up e.g. are you okay? i've noticed you've lost/gained weight. 
ask about their mental health as it may be stress/anxiety/depression related. 
let them know you love them regardless &amp; if they need help you're there
