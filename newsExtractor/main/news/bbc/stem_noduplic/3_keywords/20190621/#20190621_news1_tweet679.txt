@caralisette ex: someone may experience anxiety before a presentation... does not mean they have an anxiety disorder.

mental health &amp; mental illness are 2 separate things.

ppl may experience symptoms, but it is when it is severe &amp; interferes w/life/functioning/health that it is an illness.
