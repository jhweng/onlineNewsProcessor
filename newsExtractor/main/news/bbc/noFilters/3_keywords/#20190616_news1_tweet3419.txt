@hiitaylorblake 2014: planning to drop out of college after that semester; just diagnosed with clinical depression.

2019: about to graduate with my masters; mental health the best it’s ever been.

i may look a little too giddy on the right, but i’m so happy to be genuinely happy &amp; full of life! https://t.co/w3bpqua7ur
