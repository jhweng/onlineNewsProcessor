@idickson258 @thehowardleague @yvettestanley18 @ofstednews can’t be precise unfortunately as i’m away from home and records but think you may find it in annual report. most police call outs in relation to missing/returned or, sadly, support in mental health concerns. hl don’t differentiate between data regulated. still worrying
