are you getting enough #sleep? the recommendation for adults is 7+ hours a night. if you're not getting enough sleep regularly, you may be at an increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, poor mental health, and even early death. @cdc_gov https://t.co/sdmatxy7yn
