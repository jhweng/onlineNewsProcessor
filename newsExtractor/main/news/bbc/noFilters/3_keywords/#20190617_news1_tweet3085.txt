@hannah3_00am @schuylertaylor4 @bjontry @gnc_centric @lacroicsz @piqueresproject if i may jump in. my kid (20) has bpd &amp; is in &amp; out of dbt. i want to say that mental health issues (&amp; age) add another layer to the gender stuff. loads of good suggestions on how to help your child here. but much depends on each individual kid &amp; her situation. wishing u well!
