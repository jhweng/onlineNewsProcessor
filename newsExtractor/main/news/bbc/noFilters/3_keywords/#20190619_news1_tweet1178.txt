@ir8bespoke @shona_mu they're divorced from reality, the outsourced "healthcare assessor" dwp employ have no real medical, mental health or autism knowledge. austerity cuts mean that they're trained to "catch you out" in their questions. bad news for autistic ppl who may be confused by nt questions.
