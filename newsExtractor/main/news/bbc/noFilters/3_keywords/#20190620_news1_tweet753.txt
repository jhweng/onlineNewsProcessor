@takes_philly @chrisbrown111__ @berniesanders @walmart what happens when it’s a down year for the company?  no one gets paid.?  you are paid what your worth to the company if you don’t like it move on better yourself.  if you stay at walmart when you need income to raise a family there may be some mental health/developmental issues.
