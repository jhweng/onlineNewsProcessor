@partlycloudypat @chick_in_kiev @tolntran my wonderful dad did not always understand my emotions (usually the ones that came from mental health stuff), but was always supportive. i think the nicest thing he said was "i may not understand why you feel like this, but i understand that you do, and i'm here for you."
