@DarthLux As weird as it may seem i can totally relate to this. Not so much to your juxtaposition but to how certain public facets of someone's sex life can affect their mental health. To be honest I'm wired this way now because of previous relationships being someone's boy toy. https://t.co/eSwkX92Eak
