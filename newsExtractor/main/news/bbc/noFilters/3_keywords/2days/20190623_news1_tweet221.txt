Hey all! With our game's focus on trauma/survival, DIL is trying to pick an ethical, responsible mental health charity to support. We may still be tiny, but every little bit helps. Please let us know (or retweet) so we can find out what's out there! #dnd #ttrpg #mentalhealth https://t.co/8CgZmO7QRK
