@loum567 @jknoona143 @alexwilliamson8 i respect if you may not like @bts_twt  or is not in your "musical taste" but calling them "shitty band" a group who songs speak about mental health, self- empowerement, social issues among others positive subject and inspire thousand of people to do good to others is pitiful. https://t.co/wfnnhewwky
