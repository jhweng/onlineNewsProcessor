@theresa_may my mother suffers from mental health issues. your disability assessments left her crippled with anxiety, severely agoraphobic &amp; suicidal. she's constantly terrified a pen pusher will leave her penniless &amp; destitute. don't dare pretend you give a damn about mental health, theresa!
