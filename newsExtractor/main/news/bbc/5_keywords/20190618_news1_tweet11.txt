@theresa_may Then start taking mental health problems after #abortion seriously please Prime Minister.
25-30% increased risk of depression, self-harm and substance abuse and 6 x the risk of suicide!
Over 200,000 abortions in England &amp; Wales in 2018 = 200,000+ possible #mentalhealth sufferers! https://t.co/t1mQ3wer3u
